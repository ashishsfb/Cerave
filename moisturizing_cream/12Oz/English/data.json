	"review02": "This lotion is the best at keeping both my face and body from getting overly dry in the winter or too oily on those warm This lotion is the best at keeping both my face and body from getting overly dry in the winter or too oily on those warm, summer days. What I like most about Cerave is that it has no unnecessary colored dyes and is perfume free so that it doesn't fight with whatever cologne I put on that day. I use it when I'm fresh out of the shower to lock in the water still on my face & skin and it always goes on smooth. I purchased several containers for a friend of mine as a casual gift and now she uses and swears by it, too.",
